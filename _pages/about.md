I'm a Liuzhenghao Lv (吕刘正浩), a first year MPhil student from School of ECE, Peking University. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yonghong Tian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fn6hJx0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Li Yuan](https://yuanli2333.github.io/). My research interest includes LLM, AI4Sci, SNN. I obtained my B.Eng. from Tongji University.

**Research Insterest**

I am interested in apply LLMs and multimodal LLMs in scientific scenarios, such as proteins and small molecules. Recently, I am also interested in the optimization of LLMs, such as better alignment with RL, better numeric understanding.
